# QAudious_heroku

The project is a Web Application that serves as an NLP based Question Answering system
that answers questions based on given audio files of the education sector.
The purpose of this project is to reduce the time-consuming process of fetching answers from audio-
based lectures or podcasts and/or on the web. Hence it speeds up the learning process as participants/listeners can ask questions about the subject of discussion which reduces
human effort. The input will be audio files(.wav versions) which will be converted from
speech to text. On yielding the unstructured data we will preprocess the text and feed it
into the question answering section of the system. Post which the questions put forth by
the users can be retrieved from the context.
